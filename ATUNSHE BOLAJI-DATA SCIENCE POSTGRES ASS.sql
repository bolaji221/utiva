--Q4.  The country with the highest and lowest games played 
/* DAMILARE'S COMMENT:

Bolaji, This works in that it shows all the teams and their corresponding games playedin descending order.
But the question is just interestested in seeing the highest and the lowest.
we would discuss this in class tomorrow.


I see you applied the same technique to other questions as well.

Great technique anyways.
